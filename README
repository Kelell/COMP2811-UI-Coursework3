This is a team project consisting of 5 members. This program aims to implement
a graphical user interface for a local git repository. By implementing the 
good UI design we have learn in class, we should implement the following 
five of the following functions:

1)Create or select a git repository- based on the directories in your file system.
2)Branch navigation- list and checkout branches
3)Display commits- Show the commit history and messages
4)Show/edit settings- The git repository configuration
5)Keyword search- Find commits in a repository with a search term appearing in the commit message
6)Statistics- collect and present data about a user or a branch.
